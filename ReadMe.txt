JUMPDUINO

GAME CONTROL USING ARDUINO AND ULTRASONIC SENSOR

# In this project I have first created a simple game using Pygame where our character has only one command that is the jump.
# He jumps and dodges the incoming projectiles.

# Then I uploaded the Ultrasonic sensor code through the Arduino IDE into the UNO microcontroller.

# Pyserial is the package I used to read the bits from the arduino port.

# In the real world image, my hand represents the control wherein if I lift my hand, the character also jumps.

# Ensure that your hand is anywhere between 5 and 10 cm.

# Due to the nature of the bits transfered from the arduino to the pc the game runs really slowly. But still it is fun to play.
